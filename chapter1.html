        <p>The throne of hell was never meant for a human—except one.</p>
        <p>Betrayed by his kind. Forgotten by the Fortuna’s.</p>
        <p>He is hell-bent on revenge as his name fades from life itself.</p>
        <p>He is neither human nor Fortuna. He is something else. Every fibre of his body reshaping into the divine and damned.</p>
        <p>Slave. Thrall. General. Vizier. Each step soaked in lies and sharpened by deceit, till he claimed the throne himself.</p>
        <p>He was called the bringer of death. But no...this man was death’s vessel.</p>
        <p>Now, he wielded the chains of eternity. Hell's fire bowed to his will and even the undead dared not whisper his name.</p>
        <p>Glowing fire possessed his eyes, his face bathed in bitter satisfaction. His voice sent chills down the spine of hell at once.</p>
        <p><em>“It is time.”</em></p>

        <p>Far away from scorching hell…</p>
        <p>Beneath a sun still warm and sky still blue…</p>
        <p>A boy walks home from school—unaware of the journey and darkness that lies ahead.</p>
        <p>“I’m a year older—so I’m 17 now.”</p>
        <p>“Ohh, yeah. I gotta go see Mom at the hospital.”</p>
        <p>“I don’t think I’ve seen—”</p>
        <p><strong>WHACK</strong></p>
        <p>A banana smacked him in the head.</p>
        <p>“I’ve been around school looking for your ass!” she says while heaving for breath and wiping the sweat from her brow.</p>
        <p>Darian hands her a napkin, secretly fascinated by her beauty.</p>
        <p>“Didn’t you hear me? Where you been?” she asked.</p>
        <p>“Ohh I’m sorry. I was at band practice.” He looked away. “I was just thinking about you. I haven’t seen you in a while.”</p>
        <p>“Yeah me too. I’ve been occupied with basketball classes.”</p>
        <p>“What are you doing?” Darian asked, confused, as she dug through his bag.</p>
        <p>“There it is, I’m looking for your test results. Wanna compare them to mine.” She sat on the nearest bench, voice serious.</p>
        <p>“You could’ve just asked,” he sighed mock-annoyed.</p>
        <p>“Somehow you always seem to beat me, don’t ya?” She smirked, eyes glinting with admiration.</p>
        <p>“You said you were looking for me. Why?”</p>
        <p>“Ohh, right. Gotcha something. Never understood your obsession with the guy, but here you go—Happy birthday.”</p>
        <p>She hands him a piece of hard paper. Surprised, he took it gently.</p>
        <p>“You got me tickets...to the Death Note cosplay event?”</p>
        <p>“I thought they were sold out!” he said, smiling wide.</p>
        <p>She giggled. “My mom’s friends with the organiser. You’ll get to hang out with him the whole time.”</p>
        <p>“Thank you, Natsuki.”</p>
        <p>“I’m gonna be late, I’ve gotta go.” They bid goodbye.</p>
        <p>Arriving home, he noticed a wrapped present on the table—his father’s gift. He tore it open. Inside was a ring, silver, carved with the family crest.</p>
        <p>“A ring...with a Kamon?” He slid it onto his middle finger.</p>
        <p>Most of the day blurred into reading, gaming, cake. All celebrated alone. And yet...he seemed content.</p>

        <p><strong>Clank.</strong> The door closed behind him as he left for the hospital. The streets were busy as usual, but something felt off. A chill in the air.</p>
        <p>Cars hummed past. Parents called their kids in. Digital billboards highlighted new generator inventions and gaming wars.</p>
        <p>“Why’s it cold? Even the ring’s freezing?” he muttered, hands in his sleeves.</p>
        <p>He enters the hospital; the antiseptic smell hits him. The ring felt tighter and heavier. He ignored it.</p>
        <p>His mother still lay in bed, sheets pulled to her stomach. Her breathing was shallow. Holding back tears was the hardest thing he'd ever done.</p>
        <p>“Mom, how are you feeling?” His voice cracked with concern.</p>
        <p>“Have you been taking your meds?” Silence. “You’re still not gonna talk, huh?”</p>
        <p>He spoke for her—stories of winning online chess, grades, band practice—until finally her voice cut through.</p>
        <p>“Do you...have any friends?”</p>
        <p>He froze. “…I have Natsuki,” he whispered.</p>
        <p>“She’s not your friend.” Her pale eyes cut into him. “Why would anyone want to be around you?”</p>
        <p>Confused, he asked, “What are you talking about?”</p>
        <p>She turned away. Tears slid down her face. “I never wanted a child,” she said. “I wanted my body. Beautiful—like in my youth.”</p>
        <p>“You came along and ruined it. I was a model. People loved me. Now no one even knows who I am.”</p>
        <p>“You took it all from me. I regret ever having you.” Her hands shot out, clutching his shirt with trembling rage. “You were a mistake.”</p>
        <p>Silence. He wanted to scream but couldn’t—like razors at his throat. He handed her a cup of water. She slapped it away—hard.</p>
        <p><strong>CRASH.</strong> The glass shattered mid-air. A shard sliced into his palm. Blood dripped, slow and steady. He didn’t cry or flinch.</p>
        <p>“Why did you do that?” his voice low, broken.</p>
        <p>“Get out,” his mother said. “Get out!” she yelled.</p>
        <p>Beep. Beep. Beep. The EKG rang.</p>
        <p>“Mom...Mom.” No response.</p>
        <p>The door BANGs open. His footsteps echo in the hall. He speeds, slips, gets back up—her words replaying: 'Mistake. Regret. You took it all away from me.'”</p>
        <p>He reaches doctors, breathless. “My mother—HELP her!” The doctors rush in. He lunges forward but a nurse blocks him. “Stay back,” she orders. He obeys. He calls his dad—no answer. Texts—no reply.</p>
        <p>The nurse calls his name: “Mr Vale. Mr Vale.” He slowly looks up. Silence. The monitors keep beeping.</p>
