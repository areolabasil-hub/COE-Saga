DEPLOY INSTRUCTIONS (quick)

Option A — Netlify (recommended for quick sharing)
1. Zip the folder and go to https://app.netlify.com/drop
2. Drag & drop the zip or folder. Netlify will upload and give you a live link (e.g., https://chains-of-eternity-xxxx.netlify.app)
3. To change content, update files locally and drag the folder again (or connect a GitHub repo for automatic deploys).

Option B — GitHub Pages
1. Create a new GitHub repo. Commit all files (index.html, chapter1.html, chapters.html, glossary.html, style.css, script.js, assets/)
2. In repo settings -> Pages, choose the branch (main) and / (root). Save. GitHub will provide a link in a few minutes.

Notes on comments & glossary:
- For comments, the easiest lightweight option is to add Disqus. Create a Disqus shortname at https://disqus.com/admin/create/
- Insert Disqus embed code into the chapter pages where you want comments.
- Glossary is included as glossary.html — edit it to add more terms.
